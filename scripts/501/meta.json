  "setup": "Requires LinkMovement.zh and SolidFFCs.zh1.Set up solid combo with blank tile for CMB_JUMP_PUSHBLOCK_SOLID constant.2. Effect Width and Height used. If TileHeight is greater than EffectHeight / 16, then the script calls JumpPush Renderer, so FFC sprite rendering is aligned to bottom edge of FFC`s hitbox. D0 - bracelet level requirement. D1 - allowed push directions. Add together - 1-up, 2-down, 4-left, 8-right. 0 for all directions. D2 - add together: 1 - gets stuck after 1 push, 2 - gets stuck when landing on trigger, 4 - unused, 8 - ignore triggers, 16 - require triggers with same CSet as FFC`s Cset, 32 - animation on push (uses next combo in list) D3 - jumping distance per push, in combos.",
